# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# movie = Movie.new(title: "Frozen", year: 2013, plot: "Bad Parenting Begets the Next IceAge")
# movie.save
# movie = Movie.new(title: "Karate Kid", year: 1984, plot: "Bullied kid solves all of his problems by learning how to kick people in the face")
# movie.save
# movie = Movie.new(title: "Taken", year: 2009, plot: "he doesnt know who you are but he will kill you")
# movie.save
